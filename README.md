READ THIS: This theme is on both Light and Dark Theme of Discord, if you want to use this theme, install BetterDiscord (https//betterdiscord.net/) and then install my theme on "C:\Users\YOURUSER\AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\themes".

If you find any bug in my theme you can tell to me in the #themes on the Official BetterDiscord server (On Discord of course), or you can PM me too.

I will probably make some updates in the future, because there is a lot of things to add too, also, thanks for wasting some time of your life to read this thing that doesn't help in anything (except the "bugs" part, this one is important).
